			<h3>Fatherhood Programs in <span class="bold">South Carolina</span></h3>

			<p class="wrapper">A network of six fatherhood programs in eleven communities crisscross the state. Regardless of where a father lives, a fatherhood program is within 50 miles of him.  While most fathers from the immediate community around a fatherhood program site attend the fatherhood programs, fathers from outside the county are welcome to participate.  Transportation is often the greatest barrier to participation. Check out the locations of the fatherhood programs to find the fatherhood program nearest to you. </p>
